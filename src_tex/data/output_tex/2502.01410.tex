\begin{abstract}
We provide a new sufficient condition to detect the finite convergence of moment relaxations of polynomial optimization problems with correlative sparsity. The condition requires that certain moment matrices in the relaxation admit a flat extension, and that the variable cliques used to construct the relaxation satisfy a `running intersection' property. The proof also reveals an algorithm to extract at least as many minimizers for the original polynomial optimization problem as the smallest rank of the moment matrices in its relaxation. The necessity of the running intersection property is demonstrated with an illustrative example.
