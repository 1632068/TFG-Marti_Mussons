poisson hierarchical indian buffet processes for within and across group   sharing of latent features-with indications for microbiome species sampling   models,2502.01919,"in this work, we present a comprehensive bayesian posterior analysis of what we term poisson hierarchical indian buffet processes, designed for complex random sparse count species sampling models that allow for the sharing of information across and within groups. this analysis covers a potentially infinite number of species and unknown parameters, which, within a bayesian machine learning context, we are able to learn from as more information is sampled. to achieve our refined results, we employ a range of methodologies drawn from bayesian latent feature models, random occupancy models, and excursion theory. despite this complexity, our goal is to make our findings accessible to practitioners, including those who may not be familiar with these areas. to facilitate understanding, we adopt a pseudo-expository style that emphasizes clarity and practical utility. we aim to express our findings in a language that resonates with experts in microbiome and ecological studies, addressing gaps in modeling capabilities while acknowledging that we are not experts ourselves in these fields. this approach encourages the use of our models as basic components of more sophisticated frameworks employed by domain experts, embodying the spirit of the seminal work on the dirichlet process. ultimately, our refined posterior analysis not only yields tractable computational procedures but also enables practical statistical implementation and provides a clear mapping to relevant quantities in microbiome analysis.",stat.ml cs.lg math.pr math.st stat.th,,2025-02-03,,"['lancelot f. james', 'juho lee', 'abhinav pandey']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01919
short paths in the planar graph product structure theorem,2502.01927,"the planar graph product structure theorem of dujmovi\'c et al. [j. acm '20] says that every planar graph $g$ is contained in $h\boxtimes p\boxtimes k_3$ for some planar graph $h$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $p$. this result has been the key to solving several old open problems. several people have asked whether the planar graph product structure theorem can be proved with good upper bounds on the length of $p$. no $o(n)$ upper bound was previously known for $n$-vertex planar graphs. we answer this question in the affirmative, by proving that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in $h\boxtimes p\boxtimes k_{o(1/\epsilon)}$, for some planar graph $h$ with treewidth 3 and for some path $p$ of length $o(\frac{1}{\epsilon}n^{(1+\epsilon)/2})$. this bound is almost tight since there is a lower bound of $\omega(n^{1/2})$ for certain $n$-vertex planar graphs. in fact, we prove a stronger result with $p$ of length $o(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\,\textrm{tw}(g)\,n^{\epsilon})$, which is tight up to the $o(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\,n^{\epsilon})$ factor for every $n$-vertex planar graph $g$. finally, taking $\epsilon=\frac{1}{\log n}$, we show that every $n$-vertex planar graph $g$ is contained in $h\boxtimes p\boxtimes k_{o(\log n)}$ for some planar graph $h$ with treewidth at most 3 and some path $p$ of length $o(\textrm{tw}(g)\,\log n)$. this result is particularly attractive since the treewidth of the product $h\boxtimes p\boxtimes k_{o(\log n)}$ is within a $o(\log^2n)$ factor of the treewidth of $g$.",math.co,,2025-02-03,,"['kevin hendrey', 'david r. wood']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01927

a kolmogorov high order deep neural network for high frequency partial   differential equations in high dimensions,2502.01938,"this paper proposes a kolmogorov high order deep neural network (k-horderdnn) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (pdes), which improves the high order deep neural networks (horderdnns). horderdnns have been demonstrated to outperform conventional dnns for high frequency problems by introducing a nonlinear transformation layer consisting of $(p+1)^d$ basis functions. however, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the dimension $d$, which results in the curse of dimensionality (cod). inspired by the kolmogorov superposition theorem (kst), which expresses a multivariate function as superpositions of univariate functions and addition, k-horderdnn utilizes a horderdnn to efficiently approximate univariate inner functions instead of directly approximating the multivariate function, reducing the number of introduced basis functions to $d(p+1)$. we theoretically demonstrate that cod is mitigated when target functions belong to a dense subset of continuous multivariate functions. extensive numerical experiments show that: for high-dimensional problems ($d$=10, 20, 50) where horderdnns($p>1$) are intractable, k-horderdnns($p>1$) exhibit remarkable performance. specifically, when $d=10$, k-horderdnn($p=7$) achieves an error of 4.40e-03, two orders of magnitude lower than that of horderdnn($p=1$) (see table 10); for high frequency problems, k-horderdnns($p>1$) can achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence rates compared to horderdnns (see table 8).",math.na cs.na,,2025-02-03,,"['yaqin zhang', 'ke li', 'zhipeng chang', 'xuejiao liu', 'yunqing huang', 'xueshuang xiang']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01938

local minima of the empirical risk in high dimension: general theorems   and convex examples,2502.01953,"we consider a general model for high-dimensional empirical risk minimization whereby the data $\mathbf{x}_i$ are $d$-dimensional isotropic gaussian vectors, the model is parametrized by $\mathbf{\theta}\in\mathbb{r}^{d\times k}$, and the loss depends on the data via the projection $\mathbf{\theta}^\mathsf{t}\mathbf{x}_i$. this setting covers as special cases classical statistics methods (e.g. multinomial regression and other generalized linear models), but also two-layer fully connected neural networks with $k$ hidden neurons. we use the kac-rice formula from gaussian process theory to derive a bound on the expected number of local minima of this empirical risk, under the proportional asymptotics in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n\asymp d$. via markov's inequality, this bound allows to determine the positions of these minimizers (with exponential deviation bounds) and hence derive sharp asymptotics on the estimation and prediction error. in this paper, we apply our characterization to convex losses, where high-dimensional asymptotics were not (in general) rigorously established for $k\ge 2$. we show that our approach is tight and allows to prove previously conjectured results. in addition, we characterize the spectrum of the hessian at the minimizer. a companion paper applies our general result to non-convex examples.",stat.ml cs.lg math.st stat.th,,2025-02-03,,"['kiana asgari', 'andrea montanari', 'basil saeed']",[],https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01953
